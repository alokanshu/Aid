# Aid for country
## Problem Statement :
Start off with the necessary data inspection and EDA tasks suitable for this
dataset - data cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis etc.<br>

● Outlier Analysis: You must perform the Outlier Analysis on the dataset.
However, you do have the flexibility of not removing the outliers if it suits the
business needs or a lot of countries are getting removed. Hence, all you need
to do is find the outliers in the dataset, and then choose whether to keep
them or remove them depending on the results you get.<br>

● Try both K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete
linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters. [Note that both the methods
may not produce identical results and you might have to choose one of them
for the final list of countries.]<br>

● Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid. You
can analyse the clusters by comparing how these three variables - [gdpp,
child_mort and income] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and
differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of
under-developed countries.<br>

● Also, you need to perform visualisations on the clusters that have been
formed. You can do this by choosing any two of the three variables
mentioned above on the X-Y axes and plotting a scatter plot of all the
countries and differentiating the clusters. Make sure you create visualisations
for all the three pairs. You can also choose other types of plots like boxplots,
etc.<br>

● Both K-means and Hierarchical may give different results because of previous
analysis (whether you chose to keep or remove the outliers, how many
clusters you chose, etc.) Hence, there might be some subjectivity in the final
number of countries that you think should be reported back to the CEO since
they depend upon the preceding analysis as well. Here, make sure that you
report back at least 5 countries which are in direst need of aid from the
analysis work that you perform.<br>

## Result:
A well-commented Jupyter notebook containing the Clustering Models(both
K-means and Hierarchical Clustering) and the final list of countries.<br>
